;; This file is the first file to be loaded and this is the place where

;; For instance is layer A depends on some functionality of layer B then in the
;; file layers.el of layer A we can add:
;;     (configuration-layer/declare-layer 'B)
;; The effect is that B is considered a used layer and will be loaded as if it
;; was added to dotspacemacs-configuration-layers variables.
